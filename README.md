# Building-a-Security-Monitoring-Environment
Used Splunk to build a custom security monitoring environment (SIEM) for a fictional organization, Virtual Space Industries (VSI)

# Overview: 
In this project, I utilized Splunk to build a custom security monitoring environment (SIEM) for a fictional organization, focusing on detecting and analyzing simulated cyber attacks. The goal was to enhance the organization's ability to monitor security events and respond to potential threats effectively.

# Key Objectives:
- Environment Setup: Configured a Splunk instance to collect and analyze security data from various sources, ensuring a comprehensive monitoring setup.

- Simulated Attacks: Conducted simulated attacks to test the effectiveness of the monitoring environment, allowing for real-time analysis and response.

- Data Analysis: Analyzed attack logs, including Windows and Apache logs, to identify patterns and potential vulnerabilities within the system.

- Presentation of Findings: Developed a presentation to showcase the monitoring environment, detailing the setup process, analysis results, and recommendations for improving security posture.

# Technologies Used:
- Splunk for security information and event management (SIEM)
- Log analysis tools
- Presentation software for project delivery
  
# Outcome: 
Successfully built and presented a robust security monitoring environment, demonstrating my ability to apply cybersecurity concepts and tools in a practical context. This project highlighted my skills in data analysis, incident response, and effective communication, showcasing my readiness for real-world cybersecurity challenges.
